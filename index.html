                Yes, we started off with a Pop-Quiz. <br> But in case you didn't know him that well, Here's your chance!
            </p>
            <p> 
                Ken grew up all over the West Coast and recently completed a tour with the Navy in Delaware. <br>
                However, he has since returned to Washington state, which he considers home.<br>
                <br>
                It has been quite a journey, but with his trusty dog Moxie at his side, he can't help but be optimistic.<br>
                Joining Code Fellows has been exciting! The people, the focus on the topic, the exercises. It really puts the neurons to work for Ken.<br>
                He does have some experience with programming, primarily Javascript, Python, and R. His favorite, at the moment being Python.<br>

                Mid-Bio Joke Break! <br>
                Q: What is an astromech droid's favorite programming language? <br>
                A: Jawa-script.<br>
                Hehehe. <br>
                Now, back to the bio!<br>
            </p>
            <p> 
                In order to really do well in class, it helps to study, take notes, and keep up with the material.<br>
                However, as we all learned, self-care is also important.<br>
                His favorite programming beverage is fizzy lime water. <br>
                It keeps him hydrated, but without the extra jitters of caffiene.<br>
                As for his favorite programming snack: that has to be Cheeze-Its. <br>
                They are tasty, shelf-stable, and always emotionally available.<br>
                
                Well, that is it for now! Looking forward to learning more about you!<br>
